i don't have the real file


# example 1
echo “git init –bare directoryName"
echo "This creates a git repository that does not have a working tree. Bare repos are used for sharing only. No edits are made within the repo and so a working tree is not needed.”
 
# example 2
echo "git init –q directoryName”
echo "The –q flag suppresses all output messages except for errors.”
