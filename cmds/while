# the command's description
echo "The keyword while is used in programming as a decision loop structure. The while loop repeatedly executes a list of statements and commands as long as (while) the controlling command (or test) is successful. If the control command fails (returns an exit status of non-zero) the loop terminates and the statement following the `done` statement is executed. Caution is required as an incorrectly implemented loop can result in a senario where the control command never fails, and the loop never ends. If this happens in your scripts, ctrl-c will terminate the scripts execution and return control to the command line."
