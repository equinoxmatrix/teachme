echo "An alais is simply a shortcut or mapping to another, often long command sequence. When a long command is used frequently enough, it is advisable to assign to it an alias. Then, whenever you need that command, you can simply use the alias. Aliases created at the command line will only work while that console remains open. To create more permenant aliases, place them in th e .bashrc or .bash_profile files. Any command you can issue from the command line can be turned into an easier to use alias."
